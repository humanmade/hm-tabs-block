# HM Tabs Block

Super simple tab block for the WordPress block editor.

The Objective is to create something incredibly flexible, providing simple markup without any styling, allowing you to integrate with your theme easily.

It also aims to be accessible. The implementation is adapted from the [MDN Aria tab role documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Roles/tab_role).

Performance is also important. The JS is lightweight and has no dependencies.

The tabs block is made up of 2 blocks. A container tabs block, and a child tabs-item block. The tabs item block is simply a wrapper, allowing you to add any content you wish.
